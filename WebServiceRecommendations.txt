1. You should add validation for the date and callback parameters.*
If either of them is something else, it will throw an exception.  *
You may use FluentValidation since it's easy to use but powerful. *
Atleast you shouldn't use ParseExact.                             *
2. The StreamReader should be in a using statement to be sure that*
it will be disposed and the file will be closed	.			      * 
3. You should log the exceptions.                                 *
